                Yes, just like every other aspirant wanting to build a multi billion dollar websites, I aspire to build Google one day. But you know what makes me different? Google isn't all about coding and software development, it is about the idea of understanding the requirement of people through solving thousand problems at once. I regard myself as a creative problem solver and just began my first steps in achieving my dreams through this portfolio website!

                They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
